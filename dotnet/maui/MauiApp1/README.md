> The accepted answer has a lot of text just to say in [8.0.0 Preview 4](https://github.com/CommunityToolkit/dotnet/releases/tag/v8.0.0-preview4) the `[ICommand]` attribute was renamed to `[RelayCommand]`. It is listed in the breaking changes of the [release notes](https://github.com/CommunityToolkit/dotnet/releases/tag/v8.0.0-preview4).
